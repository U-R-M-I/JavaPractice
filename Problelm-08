Create class SavingsAccount. Use a static variable annualInter-
estRate to store the annual interest rate for all account holders. Each object of the class contains a

private instance variable savingsBalance indicating the amount the saver currently has on deposit.
Provide method calculateMonthlyInterest to calculate the monthly interest by multiplying the

savingsBalance by annualInterestRate divided by 12—this interest should be added to savings-
Balance. Provide a static method modifyInterestRate that sets the annualInterestRate to a new

value. Write a program to test class SavingsAccount. Instantiate two savingsAccount objects,
saver1 and saver2, with balances of $2000.00 and $3000.00, respectively. Set annualInterestRate
to 4%, then calculate the monthly interest for each of 12 months and print the new balances for
both savers. Next, set the annualInterestRate to 5%, calculate the next month’s interest and print
the new balances for both savers. 

//SavingsAccount.java
public class SavingsAccount {
    private static double annualInterestRate; // static for all accounts
    private double savingsBalance; // individual account balance

    // Constructor
    public SavingsAccount(double initialBalance) {
        this.savingsBalance = initialBalance;
    }

    // Method to calculate monthly interest
    public void calculateMonthlyInterest() {
        double monthlyInterest = (savingsBalance * annualInterestRate) / 12;
        savingsBalance += monthlyInterest;
    }

    // Static method to set a new interest rate
    public static void modifyInterestRate(double newInterestRate) {
        annualInterestRate = newInterestRate;

    // Getter for savingsBalance
    public double getSavingsBalance() {
        return savingsBalance;
